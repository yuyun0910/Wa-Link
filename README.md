# Wa-Link
WaLink or WhatsApp Direct Link application is an application that is used to create WhatsApp  links based on contacts that have been stored in the database. This application is built using PHP  and CSS, while the database uses MySQL. For online shops that prioritize direct communication  models to interact with their customers, direct link chat on WhatsApp is very useful. For example,  an online shop with the primary customer source comes from Instagram, and it will be better and  faster. That the interaction occurs if the seller uses the WhatsApp direct chat link instead of the  prospective customer having to save the contact number displayed on the Instagram account. The  seller  or  online  shop  owner  can  put  a  direct  chat  link  in  the  URL  column  in  the  online  shop  Instagram account they have so that the buyer or customer immediately clicks on the link listed  and does not have to copy the number again.
